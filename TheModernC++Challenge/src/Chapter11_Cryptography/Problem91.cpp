// Validating user credentials

// Write a program that simulates the way users authenticate to a secured system.
// In order to log in, a user must be already registered with the system.
// The user enters a username and a password and the program checks if it matches any of its registered users;
// if it does, the user is granted access, otherwise, the operation fails.
// For security reasons, the system must not record the password but use an SHA hash instead.
