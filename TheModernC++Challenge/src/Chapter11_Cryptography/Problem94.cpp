// File signing
//
// Write a program that is able to sign files and verify that a signed file has not been tampered with, using RSA cryptography.
// When signing a file, the signature should be written to a separate file and used later for the verification process.
// The program should provide at least two functions:
//   - one that signs a file (taking as arguments the path to the file, the path to the RSA private key, and
//     the path to the file where the signature will be written) and
//   - one that verifies a file (taking as arguments the path to the file, the path to the RSA public key, and
//     the path to the signature file).
