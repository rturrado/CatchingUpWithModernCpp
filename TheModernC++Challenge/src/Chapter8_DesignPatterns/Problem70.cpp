// Approval system
//
// Write a program for a purchasing department of a company that allows employees to approve new purchases (or expenses).
// However, based on their position, each employee may only approve expenses up to a predefined limit.
// For instance:
//   - regular employees can approve expenses up to 1,000 currency units,
//   - team managers up to 10,000, and
//   - the department manager up to 100,000.
// Any expense greater than that must be explicitly approved by the company president.
