// Temporary log files
//
// Create a logging class that writes text messages to a discardable text file.
// The text file should have a unique name and must be located in a temporary directory.
// Unless specified otherwise, this log file should be deleted when the instance of the class is destroyed.
// However, it should be possible to retain the log file by moving it to a permanent location.
