// Deleting files older than a given date
//
// Write a function that, given the path to a directory and a duration,
// deletes all the entries (files or subdirectories) older than the specified duration, in a recursive manner.
// The duration can represent anything, such as days, hours, minutes, seconds, and so on,
// or a combination of that, such as one hour and twenty minutes.
// If the specified directory is itself older than the given duration, it should be deleted entirely.
