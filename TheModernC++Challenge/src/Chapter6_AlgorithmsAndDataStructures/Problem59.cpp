// The Weasel program
//
// Write a program that implements Richard Dawkin's weasel computer simulation,
// described in Dawkin's words as follows (The Blind Watchmaker, chapter 3):
//
//     We again use our computer monkey, but with a crucial difference in its program.
//     It again begins by choosing a random sequence of 28 letters, just as before ...
//     it duplicates it repeatedly, but with a certain chance of random error - 'mutation' - in the copying.
//     The computer examines the mutant nonsense phrases, the 'progeny' of the original phrase,
//     and chooses the one which, however slightly, most resembles the target phrase, METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL.
