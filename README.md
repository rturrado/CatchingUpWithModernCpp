# CatchingUpWithModernCpp
Catching up with modern C++.

A Visual Studio 2019 solution with different projects.
Each project contains small examples from a variety of sources I'm following to learn modern C++:
  - Books: A Tour of C++, C++ Templates and the STL, Effective Modern C++, The Modern C++ Challenge.
  - LinkedIn courses: C++ Best Practices for Developers, Code Clinic C++, Functional Programming in C++.
  - Courses: C++20 by Andreas Fertig (concepts and coroutines).
  - Stack Overflow questions.
  - Other: LinkedList implementation with smart pointers.
