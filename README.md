# Catching up with Modern C++

A Visual Studio solution with different projects.

Each project contains small examples from a variety of sources I'm following to learn modern C++:

  - Books: A Tour of C++, Effective Modern C++.
  - LinkedIn courses: C++ Best Practices for Developers, Code Clinic C++, Functional Programming in C++.
  - Courses: C++20 by Andreas Fertig (concepts and coroutines).
  - Stack Overflow questions.
  - Other: LinkedList implementation with smart pointers, ranges examples.
